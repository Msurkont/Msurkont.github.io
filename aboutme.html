<H1>About Me</H1>
<p>I enjoy spending time with my family, playing chess, video games, skateboarding, rock climbing and hiking with my dogs. I'm 33 years old and I joined the army out of high school to become an infantry soldier. When I finished my contract I began working as an automotive technician after getting an associates degree in automotive technology. I'm happy to be a student once again and attending URI. My first time seeing HTML was back when you could customize your Myspace profile. </p>
